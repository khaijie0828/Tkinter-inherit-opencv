I have been suffering for my project for the past 2 weeks. I would like to ask u guys to help me with it
Now I want to change the UI to Tkinter for some reason, and I found out that I can't inherit the camera to the Tkinter UI. 
It always having the errors such as "Process finished with exit code -1073740791 (0xC0000409)".
My project required to use Tkinter instead of QTdesigner for the UI. 
Anyone can help me with this problem? 
I have been stuck for few weeks already!
Any of u can try and give me the solution so it can work exactly what I want? Thanks u all by the way
